# Web+ Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved: ✅

The authentication error was caused by `is_superuser` field being NULL in the database for the admin user.

### What was fixed:
1. **Database Issue**: The `is_superuser` column had NULL values
   - Admin user: `is_superuser` was NULL → Fixed to 1 (true)
   - Test user: `is_superuser` was already 0 (false)

2. **Backend Validation**: The API expected a boolean but received NULL
   - This caused a 500 error on `/api/auth/me` endpoint

### Services Status:
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:8002
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5173

### To Login:
1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Use credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

The authentication should now work properly!

### If you still see errors:
1. Clear your browser cache/cookies
2. Try an incognito/private window
3. Check browser console for any client-side errors
