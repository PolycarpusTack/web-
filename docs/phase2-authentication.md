# Phase 2: Authentication & Frontend Integration

## Progress Status - May 8, 2025

This document tracks the implementation of Phase 2 of the Web+ project, focusing on authentication and frontend integration.

## Authentication System Implementation

### Completed (‚úÖ)

1. **JWT-Based Authentication**
   - Created JWT token generation and validation
   - Implemented access and refresh tokens
   - Added token expiration and type validation
   - Integrated JWT with existing API key authentication

2. **User Registration and Login**
   - Created user registration endpoint with validation
   - Implemented login endpoint with token generation
   - Added token refresh endpoint
   - Created user profile endpoints

3. **Password Security**
   - Implemented secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - Added password strength evaluation
   - Created password change functionality
   - Added password reset request infrastructure

4. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Implemented user roles (regular user, superuser)
   - Created permission-based endpoint access
   - Added admin-only user management endpoints
   - Created current user verification system

5. **API Key Management**
   - Implemented API key creation endpoint
   - Added API key listing endpoint
   - Created API key revocation endpoint
   - Added API key deletion endpoint
   - Integrated with user authentication

### In Progress (üîÑ)

No backend authentication items are currently in progress. All authentication backend components have been completed.

## Frontend Integration

### Planned (‚è≥)

1. **Authentication UI Components**
   - Login form
   - Registration form
   - User profile page
   - Password change form
   - API key management interface

2. **API Client Integration**
   - Update API clients to use JWT authentication
   - Add token refresh logic
   - Implement auth state management
   - Add protection for authenticated routes

3. **Model Management UI Enhancements**
   - User-specific model preferences
   - Access control for models
   - Advanced model configuration
   - Model usage statistics

4. **Conversation Management UI**
   - Conversation list view
   - Conversation detail view
   - Message history and formatting
   - Conversation sharing and export

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Frontend Authentication Integration**
   - Create authentication context in React
   - Implement login and registration forms
   - Add token storage and management
   - Create protected routes

2. **Implement User Profile UI**
   - Create user profile page
   - Add password change form
   - Implement user preferences
   - Create API key management interface

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

The authentication system implements a standard OAuth2-like flow:

1. User registers or logs in to get access and refresh tokens
2. Access token is used for API requests (short expiration time)
3. Refresh token is used to get new access tokens when they expire (longer expiration time)
4. Tokens are validated on each API request

### Security Measures

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (industry standard)
- Password strength requirements enforce secure passwords
- JWT tokens use HS256 algorithm with a secret key
- Access tokens have a short expiration time (30 minutes by default)
- Refresh tokens have a longer expiration time (7 days by default)
- Role-based access control ensures that users can only access what they're allowed to

### API Authentication Methods

The API now supports two authentication methods:

1. **API Key**: For machine-to-machine communication, using the `X-API-Key` header
2. **JWT Token**: For user authentication, using the `Authorization: Bearer token` header

Both methods are validated on each request, allowing clients to use either method.

## Conclusion

The authentication system backend implementation is now complete, with all planned functionality implemented. This includes JWT-based authentication, user registration and login, password security, role-based access control, and API key management. The next step is to begin the frontend integration to allow users to interact with these features through a user-friendly interface.
