# Web+ Project Backlog - Part 2: Core Infrastructure

## Phase 2: Backlog Generation

### EPIC 1 - Database & API Foundation
**Objective:** Establish the core database infrastructure and API layer for the Web+ platform enabling persistent storage of models, conversations, messages, and user data.

**Definition of Done:**
* Implemented SQLAlchemy ORM models with proper relationships for all required entities
* Set up Alembic migration system with database initialization script
* Created RESTful API endpoints for all core entities with proper validation and error handling

**Business Value:** Provides the essential data persistence layer required for all platform functionality, enabling user data management, conversation history, and model configuration storage which directly supports the primary business objective of creating a robust LLM management platform.

**Risk Assessment:**
* Database Schema Design (Medium=2) - Mitigation: Create comprehensive entity-relationship diagrams before implementation and review with team
* API Performance (Medium=2) - Mitigation: Implement proper indexing and query optimization from the start
* Data Migration (Low=1) - Mitigation: Establish Alembic migrations early to handle schema evolution

**Cross-Functional Requirements:**
* Performance: Database queries must complete in under 100ms for standard operations
* Security: All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
* Compliance: User data storage must adhere to GDPR requirements
* Observability: Database operations must be logged with appropriate detail for troubleshooting

**Assumptions Made (EPIC Level):** Assuming SQLite for development environment and PostgreSQL for production as mentioned in documentation. Assuming all entities mentioned across documentation files need persistent storage.

#### USER STORY 1.1 - Database Models Implementation
**USER STORY ID:** 1.1 - Create Core Database Models and Migrations

**User Persona Narrative:** As a Developer, I want to have a well-designed database schema with proper migrations so that I can store and retrieve application data consistently and reliably.

**Business Value:** High (3) - Foundation for all data persistence in the application.

**Priority Score:** 5 (High Business Value, Medium Risk, Unblocked)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
Given the application needs to store users, models, conversations, and messages
When the database migrations are run
Then all required tables should be created with proper relationships
And the database should be initialized with default data
And the schema should support future extensions

Given the application may need schema changes in the future
When developers create new migrations
Then the migration system should apply them correctly
And maintain data integrity during upgrades
```
