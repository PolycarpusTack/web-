# Web+ Project Backlog - Part 4: Enhanced Chat Interface

## Phase 2: Backlog Generation (Continued)

### EPIC 3 - Enhanced Chat Interface (Continued)

#### USER STORY 3.1 - Chat Interface Core Implementation
**USER STORY ID:** 3.1 - Implement Core Chat Interface

**User Persona Narrative:** As an End User, I want a responsive and intuitive chat interface so that I can easily converse with LLM models.

**Business Value:** High (3) - Primary user interaction point for the platform.

**Priority Score:** 5 (High Business Value, Medium Risk, Unblocked after authentication)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
Given a logged-in user
When they start a new conversation
Then they should be able to select a model
And send messages to the selected model
And receive responses with appropriate loading indicators

Given a user in an active conversation
When they send a message
Then it should appear in the conversation history
And the model response should stream in real-time
And both messages should be formatted correctly

Given a user with existing conversations
When they navigate to the conversations list
Then they should see all their conversations
And be able to resume any conversation
And see conversation titles and previews
```
