# Web+ Project Backlog

## Phase 1: Input Solution Design Analysis & Validation

### 1. Initial Read-Through & Understanding
* **Overall Goal**: Create a comprehensive platform (Web+) for managing and interacting with large language models (LLMs) with three main components:
  - LLM Manager for viewing, starting, stopping, and monitoring LLM models
  - Chatbot Interface with advanced features for conversation with LLMs
  - Code Factory for creating automated pipelines of LLMs for complex tasks
* **Primary Technology Stack**: 
  - Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy ORM, Alembic migrations, SQLite/PostgreSQL
  - Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui components
  - LLM Integration: Ollama for local models, API connections for external models
  - Infrastructure: Docker, Uvicorn, Nginx for production
* **Key Components**:
  - Backend API Layer: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket support
  - Database Layer: Complete data models with CRUD operations
  - Authentication System: JWT-based with role-based access control
  - Enhanced Chat Interface: Rich text, message threading, file handling
  - File Analysis System: AI-powered content extraction and analysis
  - Model Management: Local and external LLM control
* **Core User Personas**:
  - End Users: Interacting with LLMs through the chat interface
  - Developers: Creating and managing LLM pipelines
  - Administrators: Managing models, users, and system resources

### 2. Clarity Assessment
* **Ambiguity**: The Code Factory pipeline implementation is mentioned in roadmap but lacks detailed technical specifications for implementation.
* **Ambiguity**: External API model integration is mentioned as "stubbed but not fully implemented" without specific details on planned integration approaches.
* **Ambiguity**: Specific details on production deployment infrastructure and scaling strategies are mentioned as future phases but lack detailed requirements.
* **Component Clarity Ratings**:
  - Backend API & Database Layer: High Clarity (3) - Well-defined endpoints, models, and relationships
  - Authentication System: High Clarity (3) - Clear implementation with JWT, roles, and API keys
  - Chat Interface: High Clarity (3) - Detailed implementation of threading, file handling, and rich text
  - File Analysis: Medium Clarity (2) - Core API and features defined but implementation details need elaboration
  - Model Management: Medium Clarity (2) - Local model management via Ollama is clear, but external API integration needs more detail
  - Code Factory: Low Clarity (1) - Mentioned as a future phase but lacks technical specifications
* **Overall Clarity**: Medium (2) - Core components are well-defined, but some future phases and advanced features need more detailed specifications.

### 3. Business Context Validation
* **Missing Stakeholder Concerns**:
  - No explicit launch timeline or milestone dates
  - No mention of budget constraints for external API costs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
  - No specific usage metrics or analytics requirements for business reporting
* **Potential Conflicts**:
  - Performance requirements for high-volume usage scenarios are not specified
  - External API integration costs vs. self-hosted model tradeoffs not addressed
  - No specific SLAs or uptime requirements for production deployment
* **Clarification Questions**:
  - Is external API integration (OpenAI, Anthropic) a hard requirement for initial launch?
  - What is the expected user volume and concurrent session count for production?
  - What are the specific metrics for measuring success of the LLM interactions?
* **Missing KPIs**:
  - User engagement metrics for measuring chat effectiveness
  - Model performance and cost efficiency metrics
  - User satisfaction and feedback collection mechanisms

### 4. Technical Feasibility Assessment
* **Implementation Challenges**:
  * Ollama Integration for Model Stopping (Medium Risk=2):
    - Documentation notes that "Ollama doesn't have a dedicated API for stopping models"
    - Mitigation: Create a database-only status update with periodic reconciliation
  * Large File Handling (Medium Risk=2):
    - Documentation notes issues with files >50MB
    - Mitigation: Implement file streaming and chunking for large files
  * External API Integration (High Risk=3):
    - Multiple external APIs with different authentication and response patterns
    - Mitigation: Create adapter pattern for unified API interface with provider-specific implementations
  * Code Factory Pipeline (High Risk=3):
    - Complex orchestration of multiple LLMs with different capabilities
    - Mitigation: Start with simple sequential pipelines, then add more complex workflows
  * Scalability Concerns:
    - Chat interface needs WebSocket connection management for multiple concurrent users
    - Consider message queue for asynchronous LLM processing
    - File storage needs cloud integration for production scaling

### 5. Regulatory Compliance Audit
* **User Data Storage (GDPR applicable)**:
  - Personal data in user profiles requires consent management
  - Conversation history contains potentially sensitive information
  - Requirements:
    - Data export functionality for user data portability
    - Data deletion capability for right to be forgotten
    - Clear privacy policy and terms of service
    - Audit logging for all data access and modifications
* **Content Generation (Content moderation requirements)**:
  - LLM-generated content needs moderation and abuse prevention
  - Requirements:
    - Content filtering mechanisms
    - User reporting functionality
    - Audit trail of generated content

### 6. Security Threat Assessment
* **Spoofing**:
  - JWT token theft risk in authentication system
  - API key exposure in client-side code
* **Tampering**:
  - LLM prompt injection in chat interface
  - Message modification in stored conversations
* **Repudiation**:
  - Unauthorized content generation denial
  - Administrative actions without proper logging
* **Information Disclosure**:
  - Sensitive data in conversation history
  - User data exposure through API
* **Denial of Service**:
  - Resource exhaustion from large LLM requests
  - Excessive file uploads consuming storage
* **Elevation of Privilege**:
  - Improper role checks in API endpoints
  - Insufficient validation in admin functions
* **Components requiring dedicated security stories**:
  - Authentication system
  - File upload and processing
  - LLM interaction API
  - Admin dashboard functions

### 7. Context Window Optimization Assessment
* **Complex Components**:
  - Authentication implementation may need separation between frontend and backend components
  - File analysis processing logic may exceed context limits
  - Chat interface with threading may need separation of core functionality and advanced features
* **Suggested Boundaries**:
  - Separate database models into individual files by entity
  - Split API endpoints into logical controllers
  - Divide frontend components into UI primitives, business logic, and page components
  - Create dedicated APIs for file processing vs. metadata management

### 8. Proceed/Hold Recommendation
Proceeding with backlog generation. The Solution Design has Medium clarity overall with well-defined core components. For components with lower clarity (Code Factory Pipeline, external API integration), I will make reasonable assumptions and note these in the appropriate sections. The backlog will focus on delivering the core functionality while flagging areas that need further refinement in future phases.
