# Web+ Project Backlog - Part 3: Frontend and Authentication Implementation

## Phase 2: Backlog Generation (Continued)

### EPIC 2 - Authentication System (Continued)

#### USER STORY 2.1 - Backend Authentication Implementation
**USER STORY ID:** 2.1 - Implement Backend Authentication System

**User Persona Narrative:** As a Developer, I want to have a secure authentication system so that I can protect API endpoints and user data.

**Business Value:** High (3) - Critical for application security.

**Priority Score:** 5 (High Business Value, High Risk, Unblocked after database implementation)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
Given the need for secure API access
When authentication middleware is configured
Then it should validate JWT tokens
And it should check user permissions based on roles
And it should deny access to unauthorized users

Given a user with valid credentials
When they attempt to login
Then they should receive an access token and refresh token
And the tokens should have appropriate expiration times
And the tokens should contain necessary user information

Given a user with an expired access token and valid refresh token
When they attempt to refresh their session
Then they should receive a new access token
And their session should continue without requiring login
```

**External Dependencies:** User database models from Epic 1

**Story Points:** L - Multiple developers, 1-2 weeks of work, higher complexity with security-critical components.

**Technical Debt Considerations:** Initial implementation focuses on core functionality. May need enhanced security features like 2FA in the future. Create follow-up story for advanced security features.
