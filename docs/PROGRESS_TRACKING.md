3. **Pipeline Builder UI** - Visual interface for creating pipelines
4. **Code Highlighting** - Syntax highlighting in chat
5. **Model Configuration** - UI for adjusting model parameters

## Technical Debt & Issues

1. **Frontend Duplicates** - Both .js and .tsx versions of components exist
2. **Error Handling** - Inconsistent error handling across API endpoints
3. **Test Coverage** - Limited test files found
4. **Documentation** - API documentation incomplete
5. **Type Safety** - Some TypeScript any types used

## Recommended Next Steps
