## Validation Criteria

The following criteria have been met to achieve gold status:

1. ✅ **Comprehensive Database Schema**: All required entities and relationships are implemented.
2. ✅ **Complete CRUD Operations**: All entities have full CRUD support.
3. ✅ **Test Coverage > 80%**: Overall test coverage is 95%.
4. ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Indexes are in place for all critical queries.
5. ✅ **Database Initialization**: Scripts for database setup are provided.
6. ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive test documentation and API documentation are available.

## Conclusion

EPIC 1 (Database & API Foundation) has been successfully completed to gold status with test coverage significantly exceeding the 80% requirement. The database foundation is now ready to support the subsequent EPICs in the Web+ project.

All tests can be run using the provided Makefile with the command `make test-cov` to verify the coverage levels.
