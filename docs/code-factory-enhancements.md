# Code Factory Pipeline - Enhancements for Future Versions

This document outlines potential enhancements and improvements for the Code Factory Pipeline feature in future versions. These ideas were identified during the review and implementation of the initial feature.

## Functionality Enhancements

### 1. Input Validation

- Add more robust validation for step inputs before execution
- Implement schema validation for different step types
- Add pre-execution validation across all steps in a pipeline

### 2. Parallel Execution

- Support parallel execution of independent steps
- Implement a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model for step dependencies
- Add visual representation of parallel execution in the UI

### 3. Caching

- Implement result caching for expensive operations
- Add cache invalidation strategies based on input changes
- Support selective caching for certain step types
- Allow user configuration of cache duration

### 4. Error Recovery

- Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Implement step-specific error handling configurations
- Support conditional paths for error recovery
- Add pipeline snapshots for resumable execution

### 5. Security Enhancements

- Strengthen code execution sandboxing
- Add rate limiting for API calls in API steps
- Implement user permissions for pipeline execution
- Add file access restrictions in file steps

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Templates

- Add more specialized templates for different frameworks (Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Create language-specific templates for different programming languages
- Implement template categories for better organization
- Allow users to publish and share templates

### 2. Execution Feedback

- Add real-time status updates during long-running steps
- Implement visual indicators for step dependencies
- Provide time estimates based on historical runs
- Show resource utilization metrics during execution

### 3. Sharing and Collaboration

- Allow users to share pipeline templates
- Implement collaborative editing of pipelines
- Create a marketplace for community pipelines
- Add commenting and documentation features for shared pipelines

### 4. Visual Builder

- Implement drag-and-drop interface for step arrangement
- Create visual connections between step inputs/outputs
- Add preview capabilities for step configurations
- Support node-based programming paradigm for pipeline creation

### 5. Pipeline Versioning

- Add pipeline versioning to track changes
- Implement ability to roll back to previous versions
- Support comparison between pipeline versions
- Allow branching and merging of pipeline configurations

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Monitoring Mechanism

- Add detailed performance metrics for pipeline executions
- Implement resource usage tracking
- Create a dashboard for pipeline performance
- Support alerts for long-running or failed pipelines

### 2. Optimization Features

- Implement automatic pipeline optimization suggestions
- Add bottleneck detection in pipeline execution
- Support resource allocation for different step types
- Implement predictive scaling for resource-intensive steps

### 3. Large File Handling

- Add streaming support for large file operations
- Implement chunking for large data processing
- Support distributed processing for data-intensive pipelines
- Add progress tracking for large file operations

## Integration Enhancements

### 1. External Systems

- Expand API step capabilities for additional authentication methods
- Add native integrations with common external services
- Implement webhooks for pipeline events
- Support OAuth flows for external service authentication

### 2. Advanced LLM Features

- Add support for streaming responses from LLMs
- Implement function calling and tool use with LLMs
- Support multi-modal inputs and outputs
- Add model selection based on performance metrics

### 3. CI/CD Integration

- Create pipeline triggers from Git events
- Implement integration with CI/CD systems
- Add deployment steps for pipeline outputs
- Support environment-specific configurations

## Implementation Priorities

For the next development cycle, these enhancements should be prioritized in the following order:

1. Input validation and error recovery (high impact on reliability)
2. Execution feedback improvements (high impact on user experience)
3. Templates expansion (moderate effort, high value)
4. Monitoring mechanism (important for production use)
5. External systems integration (expands feature capabilities)

Longer-term enhancements like visual builder and pipeline versioning should be planned for subsequent releases after gathering user feedback on the initial implementation.
