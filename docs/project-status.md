# Web+ Project Status

**Date: May 20, 2025**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the Web+ project, including completed work, current implementation status, and planned next steps.

## Executive Summary

The Web+ project is a comprehensive platform for managing and interacting with large language models (LLMs). It provides a modern web interface for:

1. **LLM Manager** - Viewing, starting, stopping, and monitoring LLM models
2. **Chatbot Interface** - Having conversations with preferred AI models with rich features
3. **Code Factory** - Creating automated pipelines of LLMs for complex tasks

Phase 1 (Database Integration), Phase 2 (Authentication & Frontend Integration), and Phase 3 (Enhanced Chat Interface) have been completed. This establishes a solid foundation for the application with persistent storage, model management, conversation handling, user authentication, and a fully-featured chat interface with message threading, file handling, and AI file analysis capabilities.

## Technical Details

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Python FastAPI and follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer** (FastAPI routes and endpoints)
2. **Service Layer** (Business logic)
3. **Data Access Layer** (SQLAlchemy ORM)
4. **Database Layer** (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)

Key features include:

- Asynchronous request handling
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- JWT and API key authentication
- Role-based access control
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging and monitoring

### Database Schema

The database schema includes the following main entities:

- **Users** - For authentication and user management
- **APIKeys** - For API authentication
- **Models** - LLM model information (both local and external)
- **Conversations** - Chat conversations with models
- **Messages** - Individual messages in conversations
- **Files** - For file storage and management
- **MessageFiles** - Junction table linking files to messages
- **Tags** - For organization and filtering

### Frontend Structure

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, using a component-based architecture:

- **API Clients** - For communication with the backend
- **Components** - Reusable UI components
  - **UI** - Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
  - **Auth** - Authentication-related components
  - **Chat** - Chat interface components
- **Pages** - Top-level page components
- **Hooks** - Custom React hooks for shared functionality
- **Context** - For global state management (auth, theme, etc.)
