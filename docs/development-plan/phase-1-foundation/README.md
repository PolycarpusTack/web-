# Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization

## 🎯 Phase Goals
Establish a rock-solid foundation for the Web+ platform by fixing critical issues, completing migrations, and setting up robust development practices.

## 📅 Timeline: 2 Weeks

### Week 1: Critical Fixes & Infrastructure
- Days 1-2: Database and environment fixes
- Days 3-4: TypeScript migration completion
- Days 5: Testing framework setup

### Week 2: Integration & Stabilization
- Days 6-7: Frontend-backend integration
- Days 8-9: Development tooling
- Day 10: Final testing and documentation

## 🏗️ Key Deliverables

1. **Working Database Layer**
   - SQLite for development
   - PostgreSQL support for production
   - Proper migrations
   - Seed data

2. **Complete TypeScript Migration**
   - No mixed JS/TS files
   - Type safety throughout
   - Proper type definitions

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
